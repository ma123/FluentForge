    <string name="reader_error_reason_two_title">2. The file is there, but you have uninstalled the app previously.</string>
    <string name="reader_error_reason_two_desc">Fluentforge uses scoped-storage API of Android which means it can only access those files which were created by itself and cannot access any of the user\'s personal files. Due to this limitation, once the user uninstalls the app, it loses the permission to read &amp; modify files even if it was created by itself, if that\'s the case please delete the ebook\'s epub file from MyneEbooks folder inside your download directory and simply re-download the book.</string>
